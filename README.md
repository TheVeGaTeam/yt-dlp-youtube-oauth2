## YouTube OAuth2 for yt-dlp

This repository contains a plugin package that adds support for logging into YouTube with OAuth2 to [yt-dlp's](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme) YouTube Extractors. 

Please note: **!!This is experimental and may break at any time!!**.

## Installation

Requires yt-dlp `2023.10.13` or above.

You can install this package with pip:
```
python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

or with `pipx`:

```
pipx inject yt-dlp https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

See [installing yt-dlp plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installing-plugins) for the other methods this plugin package can be installed.

## Usage

Enable oauth with `--username oauth2 --password ''`.

On first run you will be prompted to authorize yt-dlp to access your YouTube account.
> [youtube+oauth2] To give yt-dlp access to your account, go to  https://www.google.com/device  and enter code XXX-YYY-ZZZ

Open the link in your browser and enter the code. It will say the request is for YouTube on TV - this is normal, as we are using the YouTube on TV client for oauth ;)

The token data is saved in the yt-dlp cache.

Note: avoid running with YouTube cookies, as it may cause issues.
